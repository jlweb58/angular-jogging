Strava App

Access Token to be found at https://www.strava.com/settings/api

Access token expires after 6 hours, includes refresh token which can be used to renew the access token. So some kind of polling mechanism will be needed
to automatically update the token (probably store both in the dabatase). See explanation at http://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#refreshingexpiredaccesstokens
